    <p>I am currently a first-year student at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science
      at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań, having some winter-semester grades rewritten from last year,
      and hoping to get some grades rewritten, for some of my coming summer-semester classes, from similar courses that were
      part of my curriculum during my first year-one at the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń two years ago, but i foresee no avail.
    <p>I have all the grades from winter semester courses already positively passed, besides DWIN (<q><em>Introduction to Computer Science</em></q>),
      from which i have a correctional term set at March 11th, before which i have to submit all the homework that i am behind on.
      Of the task sets I have so far published posts about problems with two of them on my weblog, and could use some help with deciding
      which one of the variants of solution, that i listed and described in them, to pursue:
      <ul>
	<li><a href="https://log1.mikf.pl/dwin04bmpnopal_feb27am/"
	       target="_blank"><q>DWIN4: Generate BMP that will achieve best compression coefficient with JPEG</q></a>
	<li><a href="https://log1.mikf.pl/dwin05_feb27am/"
	       target="_blank"><q>DWIN5: Looking for an online DTD/XML validator that accepts param entities in ATTLIST</q></a>
      </ul>
    <p>I am planning to purchase some cheap Polish-charset typewriter (not hoping to get a good electronic usable-as-printer one anymore)
      to be able to write legible somewhat–<q>handwritten</q> paper letters
      and create and amend paper notes more neatly.
    <p>I am presently not engaged professionally anywhere, although if I have more time I might try
      getting into doing something in Sealcode's projects.
    <p>I am having a public weblog at <a href="https://log1.mikf.pl" target="_blank">https://log1.mikf.pl</a>
      and something-of-a-wiki of mine at <a href="https://wiki1.mikf.pl" target="_blank">https://wiki1.mikf.pl</a>.
    <p>I live in proximity to the tram loop Sobieskiego, in a flat shared with four other university students,
      with my room & shared kitchen windows to the west.
    <p>I am somewhat active on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/mikrfe" target="_blank">@mikrfe</a>,
      and also sometimes on fediverse (Mastodon) as <a href="https://functional.cafe/@mkf" target="_blank">@mkf@functional.cafe</a>.
