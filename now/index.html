    <p>I am currently a first-year student at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science
      at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań, having had some winter-semester grades rewritten from last year,
      although despite maybe having some matching grades for some of my coming summer-semester classes, from similar courses that were
      part of my curriculum during my first year-one at the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń two years ago, i foresee no avail to
      get anything rewritten this semester.
    <p>Everything went remote now, and seems about to continue being remote till May or something, containing the Easter break.
      Im not going home Easter, because epidemic and i dont want to risk.
    <p>By now, just recently having got DWIN graded, i got everything from winter semester passed already.
    <p>I am presently not engaged professionally anywhere, although if I have more time I might try
      getting into doing something in Sealcode's projects. I'm active in their community but so far i dont
      feel enough connection with their projects and also still am too busy with my current classes that i fell
      a little behind on but im catching up with all the assignments now and soon i should be up to date with it all.
    <p>Recently i even started playing Minetest on their freshly-raised server occasionally.</p>
    <p>I am having a public weblog at <a href="https://log1.mikf.pl" target="_blank">https://log1.mikf.pl</a>
      and something-of-a-wiki of mine at <a href="https://wiki1.mikf.pl" target="_blank">https://wiki1.mikf.pl</a>.
    <p>I doing tasks like
      <a href="https://log1.mikf.pl/tin5-apr9am/">TIN05: having to do pixel-perfect html&css to match image,
        an exercise that felt really bad</a> and <a href="https://wiki1.mikf.pl/jq/preceding.html">jq: last preceding not-satisfying element</a>
        and <a href="https://wiki1.mikf.pl/websitesapis/wikipedia/seealso.sh.html">A script for getting a Wikipedia article's <q>See also</q>
          using MediaWiki Parsing API efficiently</a>, and soon im gonna be doing stuff like
          <a href="https://kino.vm.wmi.amu.edu.pl/06en.htm#assessment-tasks">this installing WordPress assignment</a>.
    <p>I live in proximity to the tram loop Sobieskiego, in a flat shared with four other university students,
      with my room & shared kitchen windows to the west. Presently i am happily alone in here for the epidemic&amp;Easter.
    <p>I am somewhat active on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/mikrfe" target="_blank">@mikrfe</a>,
      and also sometimes on fediverse (Mastodon) as <a href="https://functional.cafe/@mkf" target="_blank">@mkf@functional.cafe</a>.
