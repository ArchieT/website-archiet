    <p>I am currently a second-year student at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science
      at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań.
    <p>Everything on my courses is still remote, but I choose to stay in Poznań, for personal and job-seeking reasons.
    <p>I live in proximity to the tram loop Sobieskiego, in a flat shared with four other university students,
      with my room & shared kitchen windows to the west. I was alone in here for some time, but now nearly everyone is back.
    <p>I am presently not engaged professionally anywhere, although if I have more time I might try
      getting into doing something in Sealcode's projects. I'm active in their community but so far i dont
      feel enough connection with their projects and also still am too busy with my current classes that i fell
      a little behind on but im catching up with all the assignments now and soon i should be up to date with it all.
    <p>I wish i could get back to having a job, sustaining myself or even earning any money.
       I wonder how much of a chance do i have at a programming job,
       or any IT (although i don't know how i would do in anything else than programming).
    <p>I am having a public weblog at <a href="https://log1.mikf.pl" target="_blank">https://log1.mikf.pl</a>
      and something-of-a-wiki of mine at <a href="https://wiki1.mikf.pl" target="_blank">https://wiki1.mikf.pl</a>.
